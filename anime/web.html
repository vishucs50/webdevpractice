                <h1>Demon Slayer</h1>
               <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">In Taishō era Japan, a secret organization known as the "Demon Slayer Corps" has waged a war against demons for centuries. Demons are former humans who possess supernatural abilities such as enhanced <br> strength, rapid regeneration, and unique powers referred to as "Blood Demon Arts". Demons can only be killed if they are exposed to direct sunlight, decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy called <br> Nichirin, or injected with a poison extracted from wisteria flowers. <br> for more information visit :</p>

                <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: white;" >The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, <br> and animal people (known as "Minks"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military <br> branch of the World Government that protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies within the World Government that are their secret police. <br> While pirates are major opponents of the Government, the ones who challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seek to overthrow them. The central tension of the series pits the World Government <br> and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label "pirate", which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals who do not submit to the World Government's <br> authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The One Piece world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative <br> powers  at the cost of becoming weakened in bodies of water, resulting in them losing the ability to swim. Another supernatural power is Haki.</p>
